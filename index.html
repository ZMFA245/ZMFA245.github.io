                 </header>
            <p> So far, most of my collectable stamps have been gathered across Europe. 

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    England!
                </p>
                In the England, more specifically London there are 4 major locations where the Lego stamps
                are avalibale at Lego shops. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These include: London Statford Westfield, London White City Westfield, London's Battersea Powerstation and in my opinion the most iconic of the London branches. London Leicester square. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="" alt="(An image of the Leicester Square UK branch shop icons with one portraying a British icon and the other a image of Stratford UK. )">
            </p>
            <p>I am hoping to get the Battersea Powerstation stamp some time in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Denmark!
            </p>
            <p>
             Home to all Legos! 
            Billund is where the original Legohouse is built 
            <img src="" alt="(image of Denmark and dragon to make lego billund)">
            </p>
            <p>
                France!
            </p>
            <p>
                Included are some very iconic stamps from France! First the iconic city stamp of Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris. A religious and recongnisable 
                for its intricate architecture. 
                <p></p>
                The Disneyland stamp came at a surprise but my favourite one from French Lego stores is the Paris Promenade Skyline one found at Westfield 'Forum des halles'. 
                <img src="" alt="(Paris, Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris)">
                <img src="" alt="(Disneyland stamp basic lego brick which says France)">
                <img src="" alt="(cool skyline of France with Eifel tower in the middle of the picture)">
            </p>

            <p>
                Italy!
            </p> Florence is a beautiful city and I would recommend you visit it, if you have the opportunity even if just for a daytrip. I appreciate how in Italy 
             Lego spell Florence as Firenze. As well as they spell Rome as Roma, featuring the grand Colosseum. Inside the Colosseum is grand and leaves a powerful affect 
             on those who view it closely.  

            <img src="" alt="(Florence, Italians spell it Firenze)">
            <img src="" alt="(Rome, Italians spell it Roma)">

            <p>
                Germany!
            </p>
            Munich and Berlin! The lego character's outfits are really unqiue from Germany!
             The culture is represented well through the lederhosen.

            <p>Hong Kong!
            </p>
            <p>
                Just the one stamp collected from Hong Kong! Found in the New Plaza Mall (and i think discovery centre building), shows a absoulete brilliant dipiction of the Hong Kong Skyline.
                <img src="" alt="(HK stamp, New plaza mall)">
            </p>
            <p>
                Japan!
            </p>
            <p>
                This stamp was collected in the Shinshabashi Parco department store, where the Lego shop contained this stamp of someone eating takoyaki. A 
                Japan snack.
                <img src="" alt="(A lady stood in front of the Japanese snack takoyaki)">
            </p>
            <p>
                My favourite stamp! A lego figurine pictured next to Mt Fuji, plus the ink colour is green which is different to most of the lego stamps!
                This was collected on a tour via stopping at an outlet outdoor shopping centre which had a lego store! I think the place was called Gotemba outlet shopping.

                    So far I have not collected stamps from Africa, Australisa or the Americans but would love to do so. 
                    <p>
                    </p>There are also stamps across the UK which I have not seen or collected yet!
